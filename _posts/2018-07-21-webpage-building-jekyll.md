### Webpage building & Jekyll as a content documentation system.

Jekyll is customizable right down to it's core. In this page I want to just get started writing a blog so forgive my long sentences. 

This post aims to provide you with my overview of how to get running with Jekyll.
This repo [https://github.com/codinfox/codinfox-lanyon](http://) was a great help for me getting started with Jekyll.
I forked this on my own [https://github.com/w](https://github.com/wheeldogg/codinfox-lanyon)

I had messed around with some themes recently and had built two sites.
However "categories" are a really important aspect of Jekyll.
Likewise "tags" are useful for organizing your projects and blog post pages.

Basically in your jekyll directory that you are working in.
The index.html is the first of importance along with the config.yml file.
This will create the root page and this is where you are presented as standard with Jekyll with two "pages".
Now it all makes sense right. These pages are what are displayed on the site.

It is really useful to also organizing info into categories.
For example at a business a company might want to organize data science and business reporting projects.
You want to be able to keep track of projects for different data consumers.

Your blog bring this information accross and we can data into life through visualizations.

I'm a big fan of the jekyll project and has been my first real stab at creating front end websites.

Jekyll is built on ruby and serves static webpages as you know. The key here is it also lets you mess around with things such as HTML5, CSS as brilliant data containers and prettyfying the web. On top of this you make use of markdown to create HTML, Javascript and Coffescript I believe to compile.

Overall, you can do the hell what you like on Jekyll.

Oh, and you can host in on github for free.
