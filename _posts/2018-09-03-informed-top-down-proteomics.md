### Introduction.

Proteomics is the large-scale study of proteins.  The applications of bioinformatics-based proteomics includes medicine, disease diagnosis, biomarker identification, and many more.

The aim here is to start messing around with the openly available PRIDE and other proteomics data sources and build an application in Django.


##### Sources of data and inspiration for the study.

Top down proteomics.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5578875/
Access to data.
