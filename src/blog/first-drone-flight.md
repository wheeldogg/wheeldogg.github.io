There's something magical about seeing the world from above. Last week, I finally took my drone out for a proper coastal shoot, and the results exceeded all expectations.

## The Setup

After months of practicing in open fields, I felt ready to tackle more challenging terrain. The coastline presented unique challenges:

- **Wind conditions** - Coastal winds can be unpredictable
- **Salt spray** - Keeping the equipment safe from moisture
- **Timing** - Catching the golden hour light

## Lessons Learned

1. Always check wind forecasts before flying
2. Bring backup batteries (they drain faster in cold air)
3. The best shots often come when you least expect them

## The Footage

I captured some incredible aerial perspectives of the cliffs meeting the sea. The contrast between the rugged rocks and the smooth water from 400 feet up was breathtaking.

Next time, I'm planning to do a sunrise shoot. Early mornings mean calmer winds and that incredible golden light.

Stay tuned for the video edit!
